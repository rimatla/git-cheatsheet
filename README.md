### - Create and switch to a new branch based on master to explore the conflict
`git checkout -b explore-conflict upstream/master`

### - Now try merging the unmergeable-branch into it
`git merge upstream/unmergeable-branch`

### - Fix Conflits, then:
`git add file-name`,
`git commit -m "fixed conflict"`

ps: Create new branches when resolving conflicts
- Branches are cheap and disposable.
- Rather than risk messing up the branch you’ve been working on, create a new one specially for the purpose of discovering what sort of conflicts arise, and to give you a place to work on resolving them without disturbing your work so far.

#### - To view the content of the most recent stash:
`git stash show -p`

#### - To view the content of an arbitrary stash:
`git stash show -p stash@{1}`

#### - Apply stashed changes (applies the most recent one)
`git stash apply`

#### - Apply a specific stashed change
````
git stash list
git stash apply <label-name>
````
#### - Discard a stash
`git stash pop`

#### - Add message w/ stash
`git stash save "message"`

#### - To clear all of stashes at once:
`git stash clear`

# • PULL
### - Pull all changes
`git pull --all`

# Origin
### - Incorporate origin master changes
````
git checkout master
git fetch
git merge origin/master
````

# Upstream
### - Incorporate upstream master changes
````
git checkout master
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
````

PS: Note that here instead of **git fetch** followed by **git merge**, you could have run **git pull**. The pull operation does two things: it fetches updates from your GitHub fork (origin), AND merges them. However, be warned that occasionally git pull won’t always work in the way you expect, and doing things the explicit way helps make what you are doing **clearer**. git fetch followed by git merge is generally the **safer** option.


# • Workflow
`fork > clone > branch > edit > stage > commit > push > pull request > merge`

## ps:
### - When you ready to push, do it from your local branch
 `push origin <local-branch>`

 ### - Send pull request `from` your local branch
 ### - Keeping master ‘clean’

You could of course have **merged** your new **branch** into your **master** branch, and sent me a **pull request from that**. But, once again, it’s a good policy to **keep** __your master branch__, on GitHub too, **clean** of changes you make, and only to pull things into it from **upstream**.

In fact the same thing goes for other branches on my upstream that you want to work with. Keeping them clean isn’t strictly necessary, but it’s nice to know that you’ll always be able to pull changes from upstream without having to tidy up merge conflicts.



# • Obscure Errors
##### - Remote rejected (shallow update not allowed) ERROR
##### - This means that you have to unshallow your repository. To do so you will need to add your old remote again.
`git remote add old <path-to-old-remote>`

#### - After that we use git fetch to fetch the remaining history from the old remote
`git fetch --unshallow old`

# • Alias Examples
```
alias gs='git status '
alias ga='git add '
alias gb='git branch '
alias gc='git commit'
alias gd='git diff'
alias go='git checkout '
alias gk='gitk --all&'
alias gx='gitx --all'
```

# • Work flow
`git branch`
`git checkout master`
#### Once on master and ready to pull updates, use the following:
`git fetch`
`git merge origin/master`
#### Now that I am all up to date with the remote repo, I'll create a branch
`git checkout -b branch-name`
`git branch`
#### Edit and commit 
`git commit -am 'my message in present tense'`
#### Push local branch
`git push origin branch-name`
#### Tracking remote branches
`git branch -r`
#### To keep my local repo 100% in sync with deleted remote branches, I make use of this command:
The -p or --prune flag, after fetching, will remove any remote-tracking branches which no longer exist.
`git fetch -p`

#### Pull request - Once the reviewer has approved the editors updates...
`git checkout my-feature-branch`
`git pull origin branch-name`

#### Make sure that the feature branch is up to date with master, while in the feature branch, execrate the following:
`git pull origin master`

#### Now that I know that the feature branch is up to date with the remote repo and that it has the latest code from master, I can now merge these branches
`git checkout master`
`git pull origin master`
`git merge --no-ff my-feature-branch`

Notice the --no-ff flag in the merge command. This flag keeps the repo branching history from flattening out. If I were to look at the history of this branch, using GitX for example, when using the --no-ff flag, I will see the appropriate bump illustrating the history of the feature branch. This is helpful information. If I didn't use this flag, then Git will move the commit pointer forward.

#### Now that I have merged the code, the feature branch by definition is obsolete. First, delete the branch from the local repo.
`git branch -d branch-name`

#### Finally...
#### If the feature branch was pushed to the repo, as it should have been per the workflow we described, you will want to delete this from the remote repo as well...
`git push origin --delete my-feature-branch`

#### PS: My branch was rejected?
> AKA: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind

This is a special case when working on a team and the branch I am are pushing is out of sync with the remote. To address this, it's simple, pull the latest changes:
`git pull origin branch-name`

# • SSH
### • How to add SSH keys to your github/gilab
- Create the key
`$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "$your_email@foobar.com"`

> To accept the default path just hit Enter on your keyboard

- View the Public Key
`$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

> Your key will appear – copy the key text starting from ssh-rsa all the way to your username/host.

- Add the Key to Your GitLab/GitHhub Profile

- To avoid entering a passphrase everytime
`$ ssh-add`

# • Fork
### • How to Fork and PR to main Stream from your Fork
- Fork the desired repo
- Check for the remote version `$ git remote -v`
- Add the Main Repo (the one you forked from) as remote upstream `$ git remote add upstream 'main_repo_url'` 
- Pull latest upstream changes `$ git pull upstream master`
- Pull latest upstream changes w/ rebase `$ git pull --rebase upstream master`

# • Git Config
- Set a Git username: `$ git config --global user.name "Mona Lisa"`
- Confirm that you have set the Git username correctly: `$ git config --global user.name` > Mona Lisa

# • Commit History Trouble Shooting 
- `git reset --soft HEAD~1 `
- stash your changes
- `git reset --hard HEAD~10 `
- Merge Origin Master
- stash apply
- stage, commit and force push your branch
